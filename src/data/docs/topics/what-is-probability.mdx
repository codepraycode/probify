# Introduction to Probability

Learn the fundamental concepts of probability, including definitions, formulas, and real-life examples.

## ðŸŽ² What is Probability?

Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with **uncertainty**. It tells us how likely something is to happen.

In simple terms:

<Note>
**Probability** is a number between 0 and 1 that shows how likely an event is to occur.
- If something is <Bold>impossible</Bold>, its probability is <Bold>0</Bold>. If something is <Bold>certain</Bold>, its probability is <Bold>1</Bold>.
</Note>


### ðŸ”¢ Probability Formula

If all outcomes are equally likely, the probability of an event happening is:

$$
P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
$$

<Example title="ðŸ§  Example 1: Tossing a Coin">

A coin has 2 sides: **Heads (H)** and **Tails (T)**.

- Whatâ€™s the probability of getting a Head?

$$
P(\text{Head}) = \frac{1}{2}
$$

- Whatâ€™s the probability of getting a Tail?

$$
P(\text{Tail}) = \frac{1}{2}
$$
</Example>
***
<Example title="ðŸŽ² Example 2: Rolling a Die">

A die has 6 faces numbered 1 to 6.

- Whatâ€™s the probability of rolling a **3**?

$$
P(3) = \frac{1}{6}
$$

- Whatâ€™s the probability of rolling a number **less than 5**?

Numbers less than 5: {1, 2, 3, 4} â†’ 4 outcomes

$$
P(\text{less than 5}) = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}
$$

            </TableCell>
            <TableCell>
                A set of one or more outcomes
            </TableCell>
        </TableRow>
        <TableRow>

            <TableCell>
                The set of all possible outcomes
            </TableCell>
        </TableRow>
    </TableBody>
</Table>

For example, when rolling a die:

$$
S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
$$

<Facts title="Fact">
If you toss two coins, the sample space becomes:

$$
S = \{HH, HT, TH, TT\}
$$

Each pair has equal chance. So:

$$
P(\text{Exactly one head}) = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
$$
</Facts>

<Summary title="Summary">
- Probability helps us reason about uncertain outcomes.
- It always lies between **0** and **1**.
- Use the formula $$ P(E) = \frac{\text{favorable outcomes}}{\text{total outcomes}} $$ when outcomes are equally likely.
- Real-life applications include games, weather forecasts, and risk assessments.

</Summary>
