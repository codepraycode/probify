<Title2>🎲 1.1 – What Is Probability?</Title2>

<Paragraph>
Probability means <BoldText>“How likely is something to happen?”</BoldText>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
You see it every day:

<List
  items={[
    "Will I pass my test? 🤞",
    "Will it rain today? ☔",
    "Will I get jollof or beans in the cafeteria? 🍚",

Probability helps us stop guessing and start calculating!

<Title3>🎯 The Probability Scale</Title3>

<Paragraph><BoldText>💬 Let's Break Each One Down!</BoldText></Paragraph>

<Example title="❌ Impossible (0)">
No way. Zero chance. Not happening.

Example: A person growing 5 heads 👽  
That’s a 0 on the probability scale.
</Example>

<Example title="😕 Unlikely (~0.25)">
It could happen… but probably won’t.

Example: You waking up with purple hair without dyeing it 💜🧑‍🎤
</Example>

<Example title="🤷‍♂️ Even Chance (0.5)">
A fair game. You’ve got a 50-50 shot!

Example: Tossing a coin – Head or Tail? 🪙  
Either one has the same chance.
</Example>

<Example title="😃 Likely (~0.75)">
Very possible — just not guaranteed.

Example: You’ll eat something today 😋  
Not 100%, but… yeah, pretty likely.
</Example>

<Example title="✅ Certain (1)">
It will happen. No doubt.

Example: January 1st is New Year’s Day 🎉  
There’s no other option — that’s a 1!
</Example>

<Title2>📦 1.2 – Probability Words You Must Know</Title2>

<Paragraph>
Let’s unlock the probability vocabulary chest 🗝️:
</Paragraph>

<List
  type="ul"
  items={[
    "**🎲 Random** – Happens without planning or pattern. *Example:* Picking a student from class randomly means everyone has an equal chance.",
    "**🔥 Event** – Something that happens — like tossing a coin or rolling a dice. *All possible results = Sample space*",
    "**🎯 Outcome** – The result of an event. *If you toss a coin → Head or Tail. These are the 2 outcomes.* If the result is what you want, we call it a **favourable outcome!**",
    "**🔁 Trial** – One try or test in an experiment. *Each time you toss a coin, that’s one trial.*",
    "**🧪 Experiment** – A process or activity you repeat to collect data. *Tossing a dice 50 times is an experiment.*",
    "**✅ Favourable Outcome** – The result you’re hoping for. *If you want to roll a 6, getting a 6 is the favourable outcome.*",
    "**📦 Sample Space** – All the possible outcomes of an event. *For a dice, the sample space is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.*",
    "**📈 Relative Frequency** – How often something happens, compared to all the trials. *If you get 5 heads in 10 tosses, relative frequency is 5/10 = 0.5*",
    "**🧠 Theoretical Probability** – What should happen, based on logic (not experiments). *Theoretical chance of rolling a 3 on a dice is 1/6.*",
    "**🔬 Experimental Probability** – What actually happens when you try something out. *If you roll a dice and get a 3 two times out of six rolls, that’s experimental probability.*",
    "**🚫🔁 Mutually Exclusive Events** – Two things that can’t happen at the same time. *You can’t get both a Head and a Tail in one coin toss.*",
    "**🔗 Independent Events** – One event doesn't affect the other. *Rolling one dice doesn’t affect the outcome of a second dice.*",
