## 🎲 1.1 – What Is Probability?


Probability means <BoldText>“How likely is something to happen?”</BoldText>

You see it every day:


<List
  items={[
    "Will I pass my test? 🤞",
    "Will it rain today? ☔",
    "Will I get jollof or beans in the cafeteria? 🍚",
  ]}
/>

<Note>
Probability helps us stop guessing and start calculating!

### 🎯 The Probability Scale

The probability scale slides from 0 to 1:

<Paragraph><BoldText>💬 Let's Break Each One Down!</BoldText></Paragraph>

<Example title="❌ Impossible (0)">
No way. Zero chance. Not happening.

Example: A person growing 5 heads 👽  
That’s a 0 on the probability scale.
</Example>

<Example title="😕 Unlikely (~0.25)">
It could happen… but probably won’t.

Example: You waking up with purple hair without dyeing it 💜🧑‍🎤
</Example>

<Example title="🤷‍♂️ Even Chance (0.5)">
A fair game. You’ve got a 50-50 shot!

Example: Tossing a coin – Head or Tail? 🪙  
Either one has the same chance.
</Example>

<Example title="😃 Likely (~0.75)">
Very possible — just not guaranteed.

Example: You’ll eat something today 😋  
Not 100%, but… yeah, pretty likely.
</Example>

<Example title="✅ Certain (1)">
It will happen. No doubt.

Example: January 1st is New Year’s Day 🎉  
There’s no other option — that’s a 1!
</Example>

</Paragraph>

<List ordered>
  <ListItem>
    <Bold>🎲 Random</Bold> – Happens without planning or pattern. <i>Example:</i> Picking a student from class randomly means everyone has an equal chance.
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Bold>🔥 Event</Bold> – Something that happens — like tossing a coin or rolling a dice. <i>All possible results = Sample space</i>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Bold>🎯 Outcome</Bold> – The result of an event. <i>If you toss a coin → Head or Tail. These are the 2 outcomes.</i> If the result is what you want, we call it a <Bold>favourable outcome!</Bold>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Bold>🔁 Trial</Bold> – One try or test in an experiment. <i>Each time you toss a coin, that's one trial.</i>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Bold>🧪 Experiment</Bold> – A process or activity you repeat to collect data. <i>Tossing a dice 50 times is an experiment.</i>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Bold>✅ Favourable Outcome</Bold> – The result you're hoping for. <i>If you want to roll a 6, getting a 6 is the favourable outcome.</i>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Bold>📦 Sample Space</Bold> – All the possible outcomes of an event. <i>For a dice, the sample space is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</i>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Bold>📈 Relative Frequency</Bold> – How often something happens, compared to all the trials. <i>If you get 5 heads in 10 tosses, relative frequency is 5/10 = 0.5</i>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Bold>🧠 Theoretical Probability</Bold> – What should happen, based on logic (not experiments). <i>Theoretical chance of rolling a 3 on a dice is 1/6.</i>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Bold>🔬 Experimental Probability</Bold> – What actually happens when you try something out. <i>If you roll a dice and get a 3 two times out of six rolls, that's experimental probability.</i>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Bold>🚫🔁 Mutually Exclusive Events</Bold> – Two things that can't happen at the same time. <i>You can't get both a Head and a Tail in one coin toss.</i>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Bold>🔗 Independent Events</Bold> – One event doesn't affect the other. <i>Rolling one dice doesn't affect the outcome of a second dice.</i>
  </ListItem>
</List>
