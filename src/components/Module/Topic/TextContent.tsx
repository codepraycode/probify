# ðŸŽ² What is Probability?

## Unlock the power of chance and prediction!

Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with **uncertainty**. It tells us how likely something is to happen.

In simple terms:

Probability is all around us â€” from flipping a coin to predicting the weather. In this topic, youâ€™ll dive into the fascinating world of <Bold>chance, uncertainty</Bold> and <Bold>logical reasoning</Bold>.

> **Probability** is a number between 0 and 1 that shows how likely an event is to occur.

### ðŸ”¢ Probability Formula

If all outcomes are equally likely, the probability of an event happening is:

$$
P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}}
$$

#### Example:

If you roll a fair six-sided die:

$$
P(\\text{rolling a 4}) = \\frac{1}{6}
$$
